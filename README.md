# üõ£Ô∏è APA ‚Äì Advanced Pavement Analytics

## üìå Project Overview

**APA (Advanced Pavement Analytics)** is a geospatial AI pipeline that uses **satellite imagery** to predict the **Pavement Condition Index (PCI)** of urban roads.

This project helps **municipalities**:
- Evaluate the condition of roads efficiently
- Generate AI-based insights for decision-makers
- Optimize maintenance strategies and urban planning

---

## üß† How It Works ‚Äì Pipeline Overview

### 1. `data_runner.py` ‚Äì Entry Point
Runs the full pipeline, loading settings from the config file and executing all steps end-to-end.

---

### 2. `config.yaml` ‚Äì Configuration File
Defines:
- Input/output paths
- Data source (e.g., satellite type)
- ROI coordinates
- Filtering and caching settings

Automatically loaded by `data_runner.py`.

---

### 3. Data Import ‚Äì `apa_utils.data_importer`
Handles imagery import based on the selected enum.

#### üì¶ Supported Data Sources
Enums defined in `enum/`:
- `VENUS_ISRAEL_KIRYAT_ATA`
- `VENUS_DETROIT`
- `AIRBUS_DETROIT_MULTISPECTRAL`
- `AIRBUS_DETROIT_PANCHROMATIC`

More info in `data/` and `enum/` directories.

---

### 4. ROI Cropping
The region of interest (ROI) is read from the config file and used to crop the image to the relevant urban area.

---

### 5. Road Extraction ‚Äì OpenStreetMap API
- Generates a road mask from geographic coordinates using OpenStreetMap.
- Produces a binary mask that highlights road pixels.
- Pixel-level details are not used yet‚Äîonly GPS coordinates.

---

### 6. PCI Ground Truth ‚Äì Segmentation
- Loads real PCI scores from **Detroit municipality CSV** files.
- Splits roads into segments using **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** on the road mask.
- Each pixel within a segment receives the same PCI score.

> ‚è≥ This is a time-intensive step.

---

### 7. Caching Intermediate Results ‚Äì `.npz`
- Intermediate data is saved as `.npz` files to avoid recomputation.
- File names include the data source enum.
- Caching happens automatically after heavy processing steps.

---

### 8. Image Filtering ‚Äì `process_labeled_image()`
Post-processing step to clean and isolate relevant labeled data:
- Applies a **dilation kernel** to connect close pixels.
- Filters out:
  - Irrelevant colors
  - Disconnected or noisy segments
- All parameters are configurable via `config.yaml`.
